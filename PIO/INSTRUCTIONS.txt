Welcome to Vision External 1.0

We're aware of existing issues such as the dragging bug and are actively working to resolve them.

Instructions for Getting Started with Vision External:
Launch the Application:
Begin by starting the visiondeck.exe program on your computer.

Login to Your Account:

Redeem Your License Key:
If you haven't done so already, redeem your license key that you've purchased from Sellix in the settings section on visions website.

Vision Dashboard:
After redeeming your license, return to the Vision dashboard on the website and copy your Auth username and Auth password.

Re-open Vision_External:
Open Vision_External once more and log in with the credentials you just obtained.

Join the Teleporter Game:
Join the game Teleporter on Roblox by following this link: https://www.roblox.com/games/15049129410/

Access the Teleporter UI:
In the game, press the minus key (-) to open the teleporter UI.

Teleport to a Game:
Use the game ID from the Fencing game or any game with tools example: (12109643) to teleport within the application.

Attach Vision to the Game:
Once teleported, reopen the Vision_External application, click on the code icon tab, and then the bandage icon located at the bottom left to attach Vision to the game.

Initialize the Script:
When you see a message box stating "init script," click okay. Then, equip your tool, and you should see "roblox bridge starting, please wait." After waiting 5-10 seconds, a "bridge started" message should appear.

Execute the Script:
Return to Vision's UI and press the execute button, which looks like a play symbol, at the bottom right. If followed correctly, it should execute the script and output the results to the console.

Troubleshooting Issues:
If the bridge does not start or the script does not execute, restart Roblox.
If Roblox crashes in your web browser, consider using the UWP (Universal Windows Platform) of roblox  version for better stability.
Currently, there is no CoreGUI support; ensure all scripts are parented under playerGUI.
